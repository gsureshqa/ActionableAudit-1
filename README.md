A tool to track create, update and delete actions on the Entities with complete access of audit data
Microsoft Dynamics 365 comes with several tools to help you manage data. One of these is the auditing feature, which allows you to track changes made to data in Dynamics 365. It also tracks each time a user logs into your system. If auditing is enabled, CRM automatically creates logs for the changes that are tracked. But, we cannot access the System Auditing Entity. This Actionable Audit solution will provide the user to track the audit history of the configured entities and will be able to generate the reports on the Audited data. Also, provides user friendly web resource for Case entity with the Search, Export to CSV options.
